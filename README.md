# Aesthetic-ATM

A simple **ATM (Automated Teller Machine) Simulator** built as part of a **first-year Computer Science project last year**.
This project demonstrates core programming concepts such as control structures, data handling, user authentication, and modular design.

## 📌 Features
* **User Authentication**: Login with account number and PIN.

* **Account Operations**:
  * Cash Withdrawal
  * Deposit
  * Check Balance
  * Change Pin
  
* **Error Handling**: Handles invalid inputs, insufficient balance, and incorrect PIN attempts.
* **Modular Design**: Clear separation of concerns for authentication, transactions, and user interface.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Language: *Java*
* Concepts: File handling / OOP
* Environment: *Console based*

## 🚀 Getting Started
### Prerequisites

* Compiler or interpreter, Java JDK 17+]*

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/atm-simulator.git](https://github.com/phillip-mogale2/Aesthetic-ATM.git)
cd atm-simulator
```

### Running the Project
# Example for Java
javac ATM.java  
java ATM

or run the project from Netbeans
```

📖 Example Usage
	Welcome to Aesthetic ATM

Enter your Account number to start transaction: 12345678
Enter your PIN: 8888

Access Granted!
Accout owner: Mogale Gk

1. Withdraw
2. Deposit
3. Check Balance
4. Change Pin
5. Exit
Choose your option: 5
Transaction ended!
Thank you for using the ATM. Goodbye!

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

This project helped me strengthen:

* Basic **control flow** (loops, conditionals).
* **Functions / methods** for modular programming.
* **Error handling** and edge cases.
* Working with **user input** and simple data persistence.

## 🤝 Contributing
This project was made as an academic exercise, but contributions (bug fixes, new features like mini statements or card blocking) are welcome.
